# About this workshop

This repository contains the information related to a train-the-trainer session running in Delft University of Technology on the 24th and 25th of June. 

We merely adjusted the content of the workshop proposed by Barbara Vreede, from the University of Utrecht. Many thanks to her and her team for this material. 

_If you are looking at a GitHub README, please note that the slides are best viewed [via GitHub pages](https://nzr.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility)._

_A gitbook is under development as well: [check it out]https://nzr.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/docs/index.html)!_

Ensuring your research is reproducible can be a difficult task.
Scripting your analysis is a start, but this in and of itself is no guarantee that you, or someone else, can faithfully repeat your work at a later stage.
In this workshop, we will help you not only to make your work reproducible, but also to increase the efficiency of your workflow.
We do this by teaching you a few good programming habits: how to set up a good project structure, how to code and comment well, and how to document your code so that it can be used by others.
We will furthermore introduce you to Git and GitHub, which are essential tools in managing and publishing code.
Reproducibility requires extra effort, but we will focus on teaching you skills that will save you much more time in the long run than they cost to implement.

## Preparation

If you are attending this workshop, you can prepare a few things so we can hit the ground running!
We have [more details on this page](preparations).


## Schedule

Note on the breakout rooms - we will decide the composition of the group based on your choice of code to bring (or borrow from our teachers).
